	<button id='showDialog'>Show Dialog</button>
	<p id='srcText'> This test used the core dialog "Prompt" function,
	with the sample code from http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/org.apache.cordova.dialogs
	On Android with build.phonegap.com 3.6.3 and core dialogs version 0.2.10, the entered text 
	is invisible.
	</p>
	<p>
	These dialogs used to have dark grey backgrounds, and now they are white. Perhaps the
	text that gets entered is still in white type and thus invisible on the white background? 
	In any case, the typed-in text does get returned; it's just that the user can't see it.
