	<button id='showDialog'>Show Dialog</button>
	<p id='srcText'> This test used the core dialog "Prompt" function,
	with the sample code from http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/org.apache.cordova.dialogs
	On android with build.phonegap.com 3.6.3 the entered text is invisible.
	</p>
	<p>
	These dialogs used to have dark grey backgrounds, and now they are white. Perhaps the
	text that gets entered is in white type and thus invisible on the background? In any
	case, the typed-in text does get returned; it's just that the user can't see it.
