===========

Short test of Prompt dialog in build.phonegap 3.6.3 dialog plugin on Android.

Roughly when I swapped to the current version from 3.3, text in the built-in "confirm" dialog 
became invisible on Android. Also, the dialog background changed from black to white. Maybe it
is still got a white font? Prompt user text is visible with dialogs version 0.2.6 and not with 0.2.10.
(Build.phonegap.com is missing the intermediate versions of the core dialogs plugin.)

Code is the example section copied from
   http://plugins.cordova.io/#/package/org.apache.cordova.dialogs
