Short test of Confirm dialog in build.phonegap 3.6.3 dialog plugin on Android.

Roughly when I swapped to the current version from 3.3, text in the built-in "confirm" dialog 
became invisible on Android. Also, the dialog background changed from black to white. Maybe it
is still got a white font?

Code is the example section copied from
